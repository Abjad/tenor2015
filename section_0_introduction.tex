Abjad\footnote{www.projectabjad.org} is an interactive software system designed to
help composers build up complex pieces of music notation in an iterative and incremental way. Abjad is implemented in the Python\footnote{www.python.org} programming language and architected as an interrelated collection of packages, classes and functions. Users can visualize their work as publication-quality score at all stages of the compositional process using Abjad'€™s interface to the LilyPond\footnote{www.lilypond.org} music notation package. Abjad is open-source software available for free download from the Python Package Index\footnote{pypi.python.org}.
