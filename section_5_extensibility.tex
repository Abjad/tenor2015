\subsection{Compositional Agnosticism}
     By providing core functionality oriented toward the elements of standard notation, Abjad strives to remain as agnostic as possible to various composition techniques. 
\subsection{Example Extensions}
To better afford high-level, personal, eccentric composition techniques as optional tools packages, Abjad provides clear examples of extensibility through the authors' own included extensions, including: 
        - labeltools
        - metertools
        - quantizationtools
        - rhythmmakertools
        - selectortools
        - sievetools
        - tonalanalysistools
\subsection{Affording Extension through Project Structure and Interface}
As an open-source project, composers and researchers can contribute changes via git pull requests. A process of continuous integration and online version control simplifies this contribution process.
