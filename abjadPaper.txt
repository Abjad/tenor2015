abjads is not a music notation program - it’s a modeling program that happens to have the ability to generate notations


background and history

modeling composition vs modeling notation

Overview of Abjad with examples

LCSI - Leaf, Container, Spanner, Indicator
Concrete class for parentage (object model of parentage)
Important: we object model glyphs on the page — but it goes a step further: models abstract relationships between those things.

goal: composition agnostic


core —
scoretools
indicatortools
spannertools

extensibility and namespacing (it’s a library that can be included):

developer-provided examples of extensibility—
sievetools
tonalanalysistools

Abjad is the first robust object-oriented interface to Western Notation

cognitive bits Smalltalk comparisons, etc.

crucial: early assumption in design — who knows how anyone else composes? however it is, we want a lot of the same basic things (iteration, indexing and addressing, hierarchical nesting, nesting, containment, structural addressing, encapsulation) — dovetails with example of iterating through notes, chords, rests in PWGL vs Abjad, can build on ch. 1 discussion of readability and score navigation.

We should do away with the distinction between composers and programmers.

Model: Liilypond paper.

paragraph: problems of representation (list things we’ll later publish).
