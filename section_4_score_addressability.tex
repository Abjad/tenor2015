        - efficient and intuitive navigation of the score hierarchy does what mapping does in a functional program
            -containers partake of Python's sequence iterating interface (for loops work)

\subsection{Numeric addressing}

Abjad allows the numeric addressing of all score components. Abjad score components are zero-indexed from the start of the container which holds them: the statement \texttt{staff[0]} addresses the first component contained in \texttt{staff} while the statement \texttt{staff[1]} addresses the component after that, and so on. Negative indices address components from the end of the container which holds them. Python's slice notation may be used to retrieve an arbitrary number of contiguous components at one time. As an example of the latter, the statement \texttt{staff[15:25]} selects the ten components in \texttt{staff} between indices 15 and 25. The conventions of Abjad's numeric addressing regime follow those of Python's list and tuple interface exactly.
