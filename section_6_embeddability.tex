\section{Embeddability}\label{sec:embeddability}

Abjad is an importable Python library. It can be used in whole or in part as a
component of any Python-compatible system. Abjad has few Python package
dependencies and is not bound to any specific user application or graphic user
interface. These qualities make Abjad an ideal project ideal for embedding in
other software systems.

For example, Abjad supports IPython
Notebook\footnote{http://ipython.org/notebook.html}, a web-based interactive
computational environment combining code execution, text, mathematics, plots
and rich media into a single document. Notational output from Abjad can
be transparently captured and embedded directly into an IPython Notebook which
has loaded Abjad's IPython Notebook extension. Calls to Abjad's \texttt{show()}
and \texttt{play()} are intercepted, and the rendered graphic and audio outputs
are embedded directly into the Notebook along with the generating code. This
allows scholars to quickly and intuitively create music texts which can be
shared, edited and executed by other IPython users.
