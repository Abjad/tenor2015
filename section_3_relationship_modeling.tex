Graph-theoretic relationships

Attachment relationships

Bidirectional vs unidirectional pointers.

Indicator scope

\subsection{Timespans}

A \emph{timespan} is an object-oriented model of a start/stop offset pair.
Abjad's \texttt{Timespan} class affords users with a variety of tests for
relationships between timespans such as overlap and intersection.

All durated objects in Abjad have a timespan, including all score components
and spanners, allowing them to partake in timespan-based relationship modeling
without regard for hierarchical score structure.
