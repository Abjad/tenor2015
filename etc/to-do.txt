0. Add a note (somewhere) about how the Abjad docs run to more than 800 pages.
The point is important to make not because we want to brag about the docs but
because we want to point out that this paper is very much an overview.

1. Include an example of the system in action as early in the paper as
possible. Perhaps right away in "bottom-up construction".

2. Override the beams and tuplet brackets to be flat in all examples.

3. Use rhythmic staves for the examples that include only rhythms. This is
already the case for all the examples except the four-staff rhythm-maker
example.

4. Do not use encircled markup (unless we can find a way to make all circles
the same size).

5. Format URLs in a uniform way. Probabaly with the http prefix always present.

6. Remember to test all URLs in the document.

7. Find a place to explain FSC and why we created the acronym.

8. Google for proper formatting of page numbered citations.

9. Put a note into the open-source values section about the importance of
maintaining a system (not just building it once).

10. There's an implicit pedagogical or educational message in the way we
develop the system: we believe a certain subset of composers should become
programmers. how does this fact relate to our design principles?
