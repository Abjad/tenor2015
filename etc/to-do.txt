1. Add a note (somewhere) about how the Abjad docs run to more than 800 pages.
The point is important to make not because we want to brag about the docs but
because we want to point out that this paper is very much an overview.

2. Format URLs in a uniform way. Probabaly with the http prefix always present.

3. Remember to test all URLs in the document.

4. Find a place to explain FSC and why we created the acronym.
