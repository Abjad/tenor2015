1. Add a note (somewhere) about how the Abjad docs run to more than 800 pages.
The point is important to make not because we want to brag about the docs but
because we want to point out that this paper is very much an overview.

2. Format URLs in a uniform way. Probabaly with the http prefix always present.

3. Remember to test all URLs in the document.

4. Find a place to explain FSC and why we created the acronym.

5. Google for proper formatting of page numbered citations.

6. There's an implicit pedagogical or educational message in the way we develop
the system: we believe a certain subset of composers should become programmers.
how does this fact relate to our design principles?

things possible in conclusion: return to valorizing agnosticism; return to
valorizing (parametric) exploration; notational foundation; exhort composers to
implement one's own model of composition; congratulate the status of the
notation api; talk about the fact that the developers of the system are all
composers; talk about abjad bringing the power of programming to composition;
the composer-driven underpinnings of the project; what drives the development
of the project are our own needs as composers; do we mention that the system is
probabaly most attractive to composers who are already programmers? many
different composers can use these things in many different ways: there's a
feedback loop available here that may not be available under other regimes of
composition. there is a development roadmap: the roadmap contains work on
modeling document preparation (primarily for reasons of producing large scores
with many parts) extending the api with increasingly many classes and functions
that generate the intermediate musical structures introduced in the paper.
