design priorities

1. it's easy to notate score components (any score component can be notated)

2. all score components are instantiated in a notatable state and no score
component can ever be put in a non-notatable state

3. we provide one core class for every symbol on the page

4. we make it easy to build up complex score objects through iterative
aggregation

5. we make it easy to address objects via index

6. we allow users to address objects via time relations

7. we allow users to address objects via name

8. we provide a variety of ways of iterating over a score

9. we provide concrete object models of hierarchical relationships in the score

10. we provide concrete object models of temporal relationships in the score.

11. we provide concrete object models of vertical relationships in the score.

12. we try to follow the best practices of the open-source community (which has
a number of subpoints).
